# Shipping Box Example in Rust

This project demonstrates how to model and print the characteristics of shipping boxes using Rust structs and enums.

## Features

- Defines a `Color` enum for box colors
- Defines a `Dimensions` struct for width, height, and depth
- Defines a `ShippingBox` struct for color, weight, and dimensions
- Implements methods to print box characteristics
- Creates and prints details for small, medium, and big boxes

This project is a simple example for learning Rust's struct, enum, and method features.
