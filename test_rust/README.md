# Basic Arithmetic Functions in Rust

This project demonstrates simple arithmetic operations in Rust. It provides functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and runs them from the main program.

## Features

- Implements `add`, `sub`, `mul`, and `div` functions
- Runs each function with example values in `main.rs`
- Prints the results to the console

This project is a basic example for learning Rust function definitions, module usage, and console output.
