# Guessing Game in Rust

This project is a simple command-line guessing game written in Rust. The program randomly selects a secret number between 1 and 100, and the player tries to guess it.

## How it works

- The game generates a random number between 1 and 100.
- The player is prompted to enter guesses.
- After each guess, the program tells the player if the guess is too low, too high, or correct.
- The game continues until the player guesses the correct number.
- Input validation is included to handle non-numeric guesses.

This project is a great introduction to Rust basics, including user input, random number generation, and control flow.
