# Send Bitcoin CLI Simulation

This project is a simple command-line simulation for sending and receiving Bitcoin, written in Rust. It provides an interactive console where you can:

- Send Bitcoin to contacts
- Receive a random amount of Bitcoin
- Handle invalid input gracefully

## How it works

- The program runs in a loop, prompting you to choose whether to send or receive Bitcoin.
- If you choose to send, you select a contact and specify the amount to send.
- If you choose to receive, you are awarded a random amount of Bitcoin.
- The program validates your input and displays appropriate messages.

This project is a fun way to learn Rust basics, including user input, control flow, and random number generation.
