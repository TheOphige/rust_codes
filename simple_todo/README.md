# Simple Todo Library in Rust

This project provides a simple library for managing todo items in Rust. It demonstrates how to create, store, and retrieve todo items using structs and methods.

## Features

- Define a `TodoItem` struct with title, description, and completion status
- Manage a list of todos with the `Todo` struct
- Add new todos and fetch them by index
- Includes unit tests for all major functionality

This project is a good starting point for learning about Rust structs, methods, and basic testing.
