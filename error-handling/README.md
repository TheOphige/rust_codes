# Error Handling in Rust

This project demonstrates various error handling techniques in Rust. It provides examples of:

- Handling file I/O errors using `Result`, `Option`, and pattern matching
- Using `unwrap`, `expect`, and custom error messages
- Propagating errors with the `?` operator
- Implementing custom error types and handling them in different ways
- Working with error traits like `Box<dyn Error>`
- Using combinators like `map`, `unwrap_or_default`, and more

The code in `src/main.rs` covers practical scenarios such as opening files, reading file contents, and composing functions that return `Result` or `Option`. This makes it a useful reference for learning robust error handling in Rust applications.
